## Contributing

If you have any ideas for things we should include, please use ONE of the following methods to submit them:

* Send us pull requests
* Create an issue in the project (with links, and we'll parse and incorporate them)
* Email `daniel.miessler@owasp.org` or `jason.haddix@owasp.org` with content to add

Significant effort SHOULD be made to give attribution for these lists whenever possible, and if you are a list owner or know who the original author/curator is, please let us know so we can give proper credit.

## Folder naming scheme

Folders should be named with the train case scheme, for example `File-System`.

## READMEs

`README.md` should ideally be written whenever needed. For example, if you are adding folders into SecLists you should add a readme into the folder to describe the contents.

You can use the folder [PHP-Hashes](Passwords/PHP-Hashes/) as a reference.
